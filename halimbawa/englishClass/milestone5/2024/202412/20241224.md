> 【モンハンNOW】新シーズン開幕！運営さんいつもお疲れ様です♪ 

Hello, this evening we're going to some more of our English practices. Tonight we again have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki who shares with us something about the Monster Hunter NOW game.

In this video, he's expressing his gratitude to the management of the game, because according to Mr. OKAMOTO, at first, the team didn't want to add the features that Mr. OKAMOTO was saying, likely due to the available time.

However, what we learn is that the team was able to add a number of the improvements that Mr. OKAMOTO wanted, especially during the CARNIVAL event that was recently held in November (I think).

There, some of the weapons, like the light bow gun and the heavy bow gun, were distributed to players to use against the giant monsters in the game.

Mr. OKAMOTO, in particular, emphasized the idea that using these weapons, players could make the monsters paralyzed and then feel sleepy, so that they could eventually win against the giant monsters that were also super powerful.

This gameplay aspect is what Mr. OKAMOTO wanted players to experience, especially the part where they could use the effects from the weapons to win against enormous monsters.

This is all for now.
