>   海外移住先として南仏コートダジュールが選ばれる理由｜岡本吉起塾CH 

Hello, this evening, we have another new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki. This time, he's sharing with us his plan of living in Côte d'Azur, a place in France which he had previously visited. 

I think I remember that he said he has only visited this place two times, and yet according to him, it's a wonderful place especially for tourists, a place not like Paris. He says that the people at Côte d'Azur are more friendly and would speak English with him even though their English isn't so fluent. He says that this actually what he wants. 

We also hear that Côte d'Azur is near the sea and is a beach resort where people could relax.

Mr. OKAMOTO tells us that he doesn't intend to stay in Malaysia for months and months, without traveling to places that he wants to visit. So he says that if his videos stopped, it's likely because he's traveling the world and preparing the new videos for us view and learn from, especially with regard to his perspective on his experiences.

This is all for now. Thank you.
