> 愛南町観光親善大使が選ぶ『愛南町の一番いいところ』｜岡本吉起塾Ch 

Hello, this evening, we're going to practice the English language. Tonight, we again have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki who shares with us the best places in AINANCHO, which is the hometown of Mr. OKAMOTO and which is a place that is located in the island of SHIKOKU, Japan.

In this video, he gives us 8 places to visit, although in the other classes I was only able to focus on the first one due to the time available which is at 5 mins max supposedly.

So, for the first place to visit in AINANCHO, Mr. OKAMOTO tells us that we should check out the temple where he says that he used to buy the pieces of paper at the temple, because the person there would write for him a beautiful kanji character.

He also adds that there are in fact 88 temples all over the island of SHIKOKU, where AINANCHO is located. And if you'd want to, you could visit all the temples. I think this is what is known as a pilgrimage.

OK. I think we can stop here for now. Thanks for joining me again tonight, and we'll see each other soon!
