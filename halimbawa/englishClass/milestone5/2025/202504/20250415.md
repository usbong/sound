> 【全盲のプロゲーマー】ゲームの進化が止まらない「スト6」のサウンドアクセシビリティ機能とは

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is sharing with us his joy of having learned that the Street Fighter series has continued to evolve so that a blind person can now use in SF6 the sound accessibility feature of the game and become a PRO player. Because of this, he is grateful to everyone who's been supportive of the franchise throughout the years.

This is all. 

Thank you and good evening!

Regards,

Mike
