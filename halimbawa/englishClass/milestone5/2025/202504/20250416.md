> 海外の学校教育どう違う？今の日本の教育方針に物申す｜岡本吉起塾Ch 
 
Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is sharing with us his thoughts on Japanese education. He compares it with the school system in other countries, such as England, and then finally offers his explanation on how Japan can become even stronger.

According to Mr. OKAMOTO, one thing that he learned from school is to be always be mediocre with everyone else, and that if you did anything eye-catching or practically new so that your classmates can't catch up, then you better stop that immediately. For example, everyone should go to school without being late. For Mr. OKAMOTO, this is a very basic rule, but because of such rules, a person who has remarkable ability would need to face a lot of hardships. He gave as example to this voice actors.

Furthermore, in other countries, like England, pupils can focus on developing a specific ability and wouldn't need to wait for their classmates to have the same passion and dream before they could set out to do the task.

Finally, Mr. OKAMOTO explains why Japan is the why it is in that a person who hasn't yet achieved a high level of proficiency in a given ability cannot be expected to be able to give other people advice. Therefore, he must first strive to learn as best as he can while listening to his teachers.

This is all.

Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
