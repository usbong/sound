Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki doesn't have a new video, but today, Sunday, I've been sharing in the other classes two videos: one is from the Nintendo Treehouse and the other is from TBS Podcast's KOJI10.

First, the video from Nintendo shows us that we can play a number of Game Boy Advance and Game Cube games on the Nintendo Switch 2 via the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. For instance, we could play the GBA version of the Legend of Zelda in multiplayer mode with up to four players in total. In my opinion, it would be great to have more such multiplayer games just like in the 90's and I hope there'll more that would come out. Still, these days, what we find is that families would prefer to eat out to relax, or travel overseas instead of play console games at home. This reminded me of a message from RJ100.3, a radio broadcasting channel here in the Philippines, saying that traveling is one of the ways to learn, encouraging us to go out and travel often.

Finally, Mr. Hideo KOJIMA et al. say that according to data, right now there are 20 million gamers globally, and he shares with us that he prefers that people played freely and of their own accord. And we can suppose that this is so that they could enjoy the games more.

This is all.

Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
