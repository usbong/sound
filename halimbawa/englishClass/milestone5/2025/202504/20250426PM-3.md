> ぷよぷよ生みの親「仁井谷正充」さんの最新作ってどんなゲーム？【クラウドファウンディング実施中5/28まで】

Dear friends,

Tonight, we again have plenty of videos from YouTube. But just like with the other classes, I'll be sharing with all of you the new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki.

His talk for this evening is about the Father or Creator of Puyo-Puyo, Mr. NIITANI, Masamitsu, who is currently working a new game. First, Puyo-Puyo is a puzzle game that attracts even senior-aged people. However, Mr. OKAMOTO says that he hasn't been playing puzzle games these days, and he also isn't familiar with the members of Mr. NIITANI's team. Furthermore, he has no interest in the merch (merchandise) that would be given out to those people who've put in money into the project via Kickstarter. Despite this, Mr. OKAMOTO finds value in the idea of bringing together former team members so that they could work again on a new project with each other. Because of this, Mr. OKAMOTO has invested money into the project. Right now, their team still needs more investors. Mr. OKAMOTO explains that to be able to finish the project, the team will need to reach 5 million yen.

This is all.

Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
