> SM Lee Hsien Loong at the book launch of “The Land of the Rising Sun and the Lion City”

Dear friends,

Tonight, it looks like Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki won't be uploading any new videos, although we do have several more of the other videos from YouTube.

For instance, Mr. LEE Hsien Loong has a new video where he presents a newly released book called, “The Land of the Rising Sun and the Lion City.” 

We know that "The Land of the Rising Sun" pertains to Japan, while "The Lion City" is Singapore. I was reminded of "Pearl of the Orient," which supposedly refers to the Philippines, although just like with "Heart of Asia," a TV commercial I remember seeing years ago explained that they actually refer to Malaysia.

I also thought that the title of the book sounded like an epic story set in a fantasy world reminischent of the "Lion Wars" in Final Fantasy Tactics. 

As Mr. LEE says in the book launching, "Things have changed." Thus, we hear about numerous Singaporeans traveling to Japan for vacation, and likewise, Japanese people coming to Singapore for their vacation.

To learn more about the book, I've put here the link to its page on Amazon.com.

This is all. Thank you, and good night!
