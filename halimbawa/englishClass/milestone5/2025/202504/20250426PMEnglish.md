Dear friends,

Let me share with you some of the things that I've learned after joining the Zoom meeting held by the folks at the Singapore Management University (SMU) on how the university helps its students build their careers.

Based on what I can understand, the program is more for people who don't yet have many years of work experience in the industry. According to the teachers, students who apply around one or two years after graduation are welcome. Hence, if you've already worked for over 10 years, they recommend going into the MBA program instead of the Msc In Management or MIM.

In addition, they explained that we need to know right from the first day what we want to do, so that they can help us build our CV, among others. For example, the internship is a part of the students' learning that we need to think and do in earnest, because it'll help us later when we're already looking for work. This means that if we already know that we want to work in marketing later after graduation, we should already go and focus on that subject right now. Thus, getting ourselves into everything that is available isn't recommendable.

Finally, I asked the teachers about something I often hear from my Filipino friends who've worked in Singapore, that is, Singapore is for Singaporeans. I wanted to know their thoughts on the matter.

They said that the idea is quite obvious, and that other countries are also doing the same thing. However, what we need to understand is that since there are many people who're also present with us in the market, it has become a very competitive space. This means that we need to strive hard, so that we'll have something unique that we can offer to our employer.

This is all. Thank you.

Regards,
