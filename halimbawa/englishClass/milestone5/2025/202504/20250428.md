> 【雑学】何やっても続けられないのは改善できる？…実は「努力できる」は遺伝である説｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is sharing with us a study that says that "effort" is hereditary. This means that if our parents didn't have the necessary genes, then we, the children, won't have them either. Hearing this, there would, of course, be those who'd think that since I don't have the genes for "effort" anyway, then I won't exert any effort at all anymore. However, Mr. OKAMOTO explains that if we examine his own life, we'd find that before he graduated from high school, he didn't put in any remarkable effort at all, but since he was tenacious, he was able to succeed later on in life. Furthermore, with regard to the idea that 60% is hereditary, while 40% is based on the person's own individual effort, Mr. OKAMOTO recommends that regardless of whether this is true or not, we should first create a schedule. That is, if we go out for a stroll every day, then we should also put in a portion of our time to study. If we do so, we'd become used to doing the tasks in our schedule, and we'll be so much closer to achieving success.

This is all.

Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
