> ぷよぷよ生みの親「仁井谷正充」さんの最新作ってどんなゲーム？【クラウドファウンディング実施中5/28まで】

Dear friends,

Today let me share with you the talk of Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki last April 26. It's about the new game from Mr. NIITANI, Masamitsu who is the father or creator of Puyo-puyo, a popular puzzle game even among senior-aged people. Mr. OKAMOTO tells us that actually he hasn't been playing puzzle games these days and he isn't too familiar with the other members of Mr. NIITANI's team. Also, he doesn't care too much about the merch's (merchandise) that will be included with the game, which people have put money into through Kickstarter. However, Mr. OKAMOTO likes the idea of bringing together former team members and working on a new project. This is why, Mr. OKAMOTO is investing in the said project. Finally, the project still needs more financial support to reach 5 million yen, the amount necessary to complete the new game.

This is all.

Thank you.

Regards,

Mike
