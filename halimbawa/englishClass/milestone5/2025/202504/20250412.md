> ゲームプロデューサー岡本吉起が選ぶNintendo Switch 2で遊びたい作品 
 
Dear friends,

Tonight, we have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki who shares with us his top five Nintendo Switch 2 titles that he'd want to play.

In the other classes, I've already given his top three games, so in this class, I'll be talking about Mr. OKAMOTO's fourth title in his list. The title of the game is Animal Crossing.

He says that there's so much that a player can do in its world that it appears to him that players can just play the game without ever feeling that they've done everything that can be done in the game. In fact, the sheer amount of things to do is something that Mr. OKAMOTO admits is present in the other Nintendo games in his list too.

This is all. 

Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
