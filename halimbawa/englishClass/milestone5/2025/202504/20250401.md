Dear friends,

A pleasant evening to all of you.

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is sharing with us the concept of "Web Purchase," which he believes improves the current system with the Apple App Store. 

He explains that developers who sell apps on the Apple App Store need to pay Apple 30% of their sales revenue. Because of this, developers couldn't use that portion of their revenue to improve their apps as well as their own services.

Thus, Mr. OKAMOTO recommends that we pay using "Web Purchase," which gives developers about 25% of that 30%, which Apple takes.

He adds that the company that provides the "Web Purchase" service maintains a pool of developers who are able to make better apps because they wouldn't need to give the whole 30% of their sales to Apple.

In Japanese class, I was wondering how the said company could provide such a service, and I remembered that in Steam, for instance, just like with Apple, if the developer doesn't earn 100 USD in a month, he doesn't receive any of his sales income. Therefore, if the "Web Purchase" company is able to put together all the sales income of its partner developers, then it would be faster for them to receive the income. And if the amount is large enough, then the said company itself can even gain interest from the deposit.

This is all. Thank you, good night!

Regards,

Mike
