Dear friends,

Tonight, I'd like to share with all of you two videos from YouTube. The first one is from GameSpot where they have Mr. Hideo KOJIMA and Mr. Yoji SHINKAWA explaining certain aspects of Death Stranding that may have not been too clear for people. The second is Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki's reasoning behind his buying Nintendo stocks.

In the video from GameSpot, we learn that according to Mr. Hideo, the word, "Stranding," in "Death Stranding," actually came from "stranded." This is why, we find the main protagonist, along with the other living things, such as the crabs, on a beach, and must strive hard in order to survive. Mr. Hideo also adds that he is easily frightenend, and we may surmise that this is because he always wants to be at the forefront, to do something that he's never experienced. Beside him is Mr. Yoji SHINKAWA whom we can recognize to be Mr. Hideo's long-time companion particularly since the 90's when they were developing Metal Gear Solid. Seeing Mr. Yoji and Mr. Hideo, I was reminded of the story from Star Trek. It was the first episode of the TV series where a woman whose spaceship was marooned on a planet. She appeared to be a beautiful woman to the Star Trek crew, but later was found out to have been using technology to create an illusion, so that she would appear beautiful. The truth was that her physical apperance has been ruined due to the crash-landing of their ship. However, she chose to remain on the planet, because it was there where she could continue to be beautiful.

With regard to Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki's video, he explains as one of his reasons for his intention to buy Nintendo stocks is that Nintendo's new console, the Switch 2, doesn't have any rival given that it doesn't compete with Sony's PlayStation, nor Gaming PC's. Therefore, he believes that it can capture the market and make a profit.

This is all. Thank you, good night!

Regards,

Mike
