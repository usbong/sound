> 【雑学】中華料理の定番「ピータン」にまつわるお話｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Dear friends,

Tonight, we have again plenty of videos, but perhaps what may surprise us is the news from Asahi News, among others, that the Pope has passed away due to pneumonia. I think that it's incredible that even up to now, there are still people who'd want children to have the dream of becoming a pope someday. We know too that these children live in places far from Rome and where poverty has not yet been solved.

Next, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki's talk for tonight is about the PIITAN. Actually, I found it funny when he eventually used the English word, "Century Egg," in his explanation, because for several minutes, he had only been mainly using PIITAN, and it turned out that he also knew the English word. Still, it seems that Japanese people don't often eat century eggs, a Chinese dish, says Mr. OKAMOTO. However, he does recommend us trying out century eggs with tofu and onion leeks.

This is all.

Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
