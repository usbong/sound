> 【雑談】岡本もモンスターハンターワイルズ始めました

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki has uploaded a new video where he shares with us his thoughts on Monster Hunter Wilds.

First, he says that after several months, he's finally gotten to play it, although actually while his PS5 was downloading an update of the game, he was able to do the tutorial and also learn about its story. This means that he sort of got to try out the game prior to this, but it's really only now that he believes that he's actually played the game.

Next, he shares that the story may feel short, but he explains that it's really because of this that players could get to enjoy Monster Hunter Wilds through exploration and doing what they'd want to do inside its vast world.

Furthermore, when he was creating his character, he decided that it would be best if his character could be easily identifiable to be his. Thus, he didn't find having a young girl as his character suitable, especially for a 63-year old man such as himself.

Finally, given that he says that he's not a skillful player, he advises viewers who may find the game too difficult that, like himself, they don't necessarily need to continue playing the game. At the moment, however, he finds the difficult level of the game to be comparatively easy.

This is all.

Thank you, good night!

Regards,

Mike
