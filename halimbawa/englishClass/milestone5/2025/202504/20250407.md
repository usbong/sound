> 【ミャンマー大地震】タイの高層ビル倒壊のニュースに思うこと 
 
Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is sharing with us his thoughts on the recent incidents that have been occurring in Myanmar and Thailand where earthquakes have caused the collapse of high-rise buildings like in the case of Thailand.

He explains that while he's still a beginner in the field of architecture, he knows that the one thing that building structures should be doing is not to collapse. He adds that Thailand, for instance, would have standard rules that should prevent such things from happening. Mr. OKAMOTO also notes that while Thailand and Indonesia, among others, rarely have earthquakes due to the land where they're located is old, rare occurrences do not mean that they never occur.

This is all. Thank you, good night!

Regards,

Mike
