> 国外発売予定ミニゲーム筐体「Gamestation Retro」の収録ラインナップが俺得すぎる 

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is excited to share with us news about an upcoming mini arcade machine called "Gamestation Retro" that is planned for release during the 3rd quarter of this year. It'll include over 100 classic games from Bandai Namco and Capcom from as far back as 40 years ago. Mr. OKAMOTO says that at the time, Capcom's goal was to go side by side with Namco. He adds that Nintendo was still beyond the reach of their small team working at the newly established Capcom. This is why, Mr. OKAMOTO explains, his team released many games that appeared similar to Bandai Namco's games. Fast-forward several decades later, the two companies are now working together on this new project, and Mr. OKAMOTO feels tremendously happy about it.

This is all. 

Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
