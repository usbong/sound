Dear friends,

Tonight, we have again plenty of videos from YouTube, although Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki hasn't yet uploaded any this evening. It could be because today is Sunday, and he'd want to take a rest.

In the other classes, I've been sharing that since we don't have work at the clinic today, I've used some of my time to do things that I wouldn't usually have been able to do. For instance, I went swimming at the Sports Center. 

While it was cloudy this afternoon and looked like it would also rain, there was a surprising number of people using the public swimming pool when I went there awhile ago. 

Other than this, I used a portion of my time to play Super Mario World (Super Family Computer Mini) and Sonic The Hedgehog (Game Gear Anbernic). I think that there are times when we'd want to return to those things that could help us remember a good experience that we had, even if we may find that there are now bugs or errors, which we didn't notice before.

This is all. Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
