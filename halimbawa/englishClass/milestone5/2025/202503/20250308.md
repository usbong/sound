> the BEST cheap eats in new york (intense flavors)

Hi all,

Tonight, we have again plenty of videos from YouTube, and actually I was also saying in the other classes that MSN (Microsoft) has shared with us videos from Danny Grubs.

First, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki's new video is about the Monster Hunter NOW game, where he and OKOMESAN (Ms. Tapi-san) are hunting the monsters that inhabit the world of MHN. It looks like they could easily capture the monsters, which made me think that they're likely using super strong weapons to win so quickly and without much problems. However, what I'd really want to focus on is the word "HAI," which OKOMESAN said noticeably more frequently. It gave me the impression that they wanted to show us that they don't hunt monsters together often, nor take videos like in this video.

Now with regard to Danny's video, I thought that it's quite curious why people are attracted to New York, such that they'd want to visit the place or even live there, when in reality it's dirty. The other thing that we can find when we listen is Danny's accent, which we may also recall to be similar with JWONG. 

This is all. Thank you. Good night!

Regards,

Mike
