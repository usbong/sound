> マレーシア移住生活6年で一番苦労していることは…｜岡本吉起塾Ch 

Hi all,

A pleasant evening to everyone.

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki has a new video where he shares with us something that he has found the most challenging during his stay in Malaysia. We know that he has been living there for over six years already, but he tells us that the toilet is still difficult for him to get used to, and he thinks that it may be related to Islam, because the design of the toilet makes it easy to splash the person's own urine if he isn't careful. In addition, since there are no toilet papers, there's a hose where water would come out, but this too appears hard to get used for Mr. OKAMOTO. 

This is all. Thank you, and good evening!

Regards,

Mike
