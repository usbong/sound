> 定年後にやってはいけない事6選｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Dear friends,

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is sharing with us six advice that he has for people who've already retired.

In the other classes, I've mentioned that his first advice is to not believe anyone who tells you that he has an investment plan that would make you incredibly rich, because Mr. OKAMOTO explains that if his investment plan really does make money, why would he need to ask money from you?

Another advice that Mr. OKAMOTO has is that we should continue to work even after retiring from work, so that our connection with the community isn't lost. He says that in Japan, if the man of the household is always at home, his wife would frown at him more often. Mr. OKAMOTO explains that he needs to go out and join any of the activities in their community, perhaps even as a volunteer, or someone who earns, but only as high as a new graduate at an entry-level position. In this way, his wife would be happier, and he would also be able to maintain his connection with the community.

This is all. Thank you, good night!

Regards,

Mike
