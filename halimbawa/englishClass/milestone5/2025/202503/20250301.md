> 星10のモンスター連続狩っていくぜ｜モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 45

Hello,

This evening, we do have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki and his team. It's a video about Monster Hunter NOW and it contains gameplay footages of their battles against the monsters that inhabit the world of MHN. This time, I thought that the last monster was eye-catching, because it could form itself into a ball, similar to a giant basketball, and then launch an attack against its enemies. In addition, behind it, we can find a kind of armor that made me think about attacking it in front where there didn't appear to be any armor at all. Of course, there are many more things we can say, but this is all for now. Thank you. Good night!

Health,

Mike
