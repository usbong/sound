> Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte arrested for crimes against humanity | DW News 

Hi all,

Good evening everyone.

Tonight, we have again plenty of videos from YouTube.

For example, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki's new video about Monster Hunter NOW, where we see him and his companions hunting the monster named "KIRIN." Mr. OKAMOTO also says that he's using the light bowgun, which has the effect that makes the target monster sleep. This, along with the support of his teammates, makes it easier for them to complete the mission.

Next, we have a news report from DW News. Former Philippine President Rodrigo DUTERTE is said to have been arrested by Philippine Police upon his return to Manila from Hong-Kong. I was under the impression that he was arrested overseas, but what we can learn from the news broadcast is that the arrest was carried out here in the Philippines.

This is all. Thank you, and again a pleasant evening to everyone.

Mike
