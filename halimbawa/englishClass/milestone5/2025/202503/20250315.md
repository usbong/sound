> MHWコラボ新モンスター【チャタカブラ】を試し狩り♪｜モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 51 
 
Hello everyone,

A pleasant evening to all of you.

Tonight, we have again plenty of videos from YouTube. I have seen many of them, but I have clicked several, such as the new video from Microsoft, which I'd watch later on.

Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki, in fact, also has a new video on Monster Hunter NOW, and where he and Ms. Tapi are hunting the monster called "CHATAKABURA."

While its difficulty level based on the number of stars that it has increases every time, Mr. OKAMOTO and Ms. Tapi successfully capture it, they didn't encounter much difficulty in accomplishing this task, even if CHATAKABURA was already at 8 stars. In addition, it appears that the main difference that we can observe in the CHATAKABURA's is its max Health Points (HP) or defense points, so that Mr. OKAMOTO and Ms. Tapi would need to hit it with their attacks much more frequently than the low-starred version of the monster. We can imagine that simply changing the max HP would be too difficult to do as well for the developers.

This is all for now. Thank you and good night!

Regards,

Mike
