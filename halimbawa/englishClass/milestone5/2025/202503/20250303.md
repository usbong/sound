Hi all,

Tonight, we have again a video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki and also a video from Mr. HARADA, Katsuhiro.

First, with regard to Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki's new video, we find that he's sharing with us his thoughts on why certain people look much younger than their actual age, or look much older, even though they're supposedly much younger. Mr. OKAMOTO tells us that there are several ways to make oneself look younger, for instance, using makeup to look younger. However, he also advises us that at times too much makeup actually ruins the skin, so we need to be careful with such things. Another way to look younger is through posture. He says that slouching makes a person look older. Of course, there are many more things that he said, but I'll need to stop here for now.

The next video is from Mr. HARADA. Here we get to see Lily and Michael being interviewed by Mr. HARADA inside his bar, and we can somehow get an understanding of their personalities and economic status. I was saying in the other classes that I think we can find such young people at university, except that in this case, they seem to have gotten so much wealthier by joining eSports. However, it also looks like they won't anymore be able to get out of this industry, where they'd need to spend more and more of their time and money.

This is all. Thank you. Good night.

Regards,

Mike
