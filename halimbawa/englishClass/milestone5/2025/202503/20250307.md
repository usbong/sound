> 【カプコン開発トップ交代のニュースを語る】ゲームプロデューサー岡本吉起のYouTubeライブ(25年3月7日) 

Hi all,

Tonight, we have a LIVE video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki who shares with us his story with CAPCOM back when the company was only just starting, although he says that he wasn't a founder, but employee#9.

In the other languages, I've been relating the story in pieces based on the order of the events.

In the previous class, in Japanese, I was sharing that Mr. OKAMOTO was asked by CAPCOM's president at the time, Mr. TSUJIMOTO, Kenzo, how much he'd want to get for his monthly salary. And what we hear is that he'd go for 2 million yen per month. 

If we think about it, the amount that he's asking appears to be too much, but it's telling, because Mr. SAKAI who was his direct superior at the time, eventually left CAPCOM after getting into a fight with Mr. OKAMOTO.

We know based on the earlier parts of the story that products that don't sell are a loss to the company.

And we can imagine that Mr. OKAMOTO needs 2 million yen, so that as the producer, if his game doesn't get buyers, then he'd use his own salary to bring in the sales for the company.

This is all. Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
