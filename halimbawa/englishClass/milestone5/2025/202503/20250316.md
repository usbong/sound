> 【３画面】星９ディノバルド連続狩猟！レア６素材いくつ出る？｜モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 52

Hello everyone,

A good evening to all of you.

Tonight, we have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki. Although today is Sunday, he does have something that he'd want to share with us tonight. We know that usually he'd do something else during Sundays, but perhaps he wanted to tell us that they are still putting in effort in making the Monster Hunter NOW game so much better.

In the video, we can see that Mr. OKAMOTO is with two companions who seem to be Mr. MASAMI and Mr. KAZUMA based on their voices. Moreover, their goal is to hunt the monster called "DINOBARDO."

From the gameplay footages, we can also see that the monster has a tail that glows, and instinct would tell us that if we hit that tail, we could deal it damage, and in fact the monster receives more damage when it's hit there.

The other thing that I wanted to share is that the hunters could also do rolls to evade incoming enemy attacks. It reminded me of Shock Troopers 1, but in this case, it's in 3D. And in Spanish class, I was saying too that viewers could probably come up with all sorts of ideas based on what we can see in Monster Hunter NOW and then transfer them to another game.

As always, there are many more things to share with you all, but I'll need to stop here already.

Thank you, and until next time!

Regards,

Mike
