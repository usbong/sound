> 激ムズ星10ティガレックス攻略！全力でシーズン4やり切るで｜モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 57

Hello everyone,

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki's new video is about he and his team's battles against the 10-starred monsters that inhabit the world of Monster Hunter NOW. Moreover, what we can see is that their team can easily win and successfully capture the monsters. Mr. OKAMOTO tells us that it's because his teammates are powerful, even if he isn't. Also, we can again hear the word, "rare," being spoken after winning one of their battles, and we know that the items that come out are supposed to make hunting even easier for the players. Of course, the rarer the item, the better.

This is all. Thank you. Good night!

Regards,

Mike
