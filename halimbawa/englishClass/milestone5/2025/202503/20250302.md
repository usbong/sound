> Counter-Strike creator Minh Le on how Doom, Wolfenstein & Rainbow Six shaped him | Playback 

Hi all,

Tonight, we don't yet have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki, and it's maybe because he opted to take some time off from his usual activities. Today is Sunday after all.

Nevertheless, we do have plenty of videos from YouTube. In the other classes, I've been sharing the new video from PC Gamer, where they got Minh Le, the creator of Counter-Strike, to talk about the games that influenced him.

While there are quite a number of things that we can learn from the video, what I wanted to focus on is the first part where Minh shares his story when he was only a child, and his father would bring home the computers that he bought at the time. 

I wondered what could have been the reason why he'd buy those things, and I imagined that he probably thought that these could help him in his work. For instance, those who knew how to use the computer could rise to a higher position much faster than those who couldn't figure out how to use the thing. Of course, that meant that he could also bring home a higher income.

Meanwhile, his children were able to try out the computers much earlier than perhaps other kids, which eventually led to their finding jobs related to computers later in life.

This is all. Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
