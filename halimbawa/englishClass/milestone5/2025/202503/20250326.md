Hello everyone,

Tonight, I'd like to share with you two things. The first is the video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki on Mr. IKENAMI, Shotaro, and the second is the Zoom meeting I just attended with the team at Singapore Management University (SMU).

First, the video from Mr. OKAMOTO introduces us to Mr. IKENAMI, Shotaro, a Japanes writer who's inquiry focused on "How would you you live?" Mr. OKAMOTO explains that the answer is to reduce the amount of regrets that we may have later in life. He cites his own life where he says that whichever part you cut, you'll find that he's had a fun and amusing life. 

Second, the Zoom meeting from SMU helps us learn about the opportunities available to those who may want to take the leap and move there, whether it's only for a short term or for something much longer. My impression is that it's a way to transition oneself to life in Singapore if you're from another country by studying at their university instead of immediately going there to get a job, which would likely not be as high paying. However, as Archie, an alumni of SMU, has shown, there are applicants who do find work first before studying at SMU. In this case, they could later earn more income by going to a higher position at their companies. 

This is all. Thank you, good night!

Regards,

Mike
