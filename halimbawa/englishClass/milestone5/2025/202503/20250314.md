> 【Nianticゲーム事業売却のニュースを語る】ゲームプロデューサー岡本吉起のYouTubeライブ(25年3月14日) 

Hi all,

A pleasant evening to everyone.

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki has a LIVE video where he shares with us the news that Niantic is getting bought for over a billion yen by a company called "Scopey" whose name isn't too well-known, but is in fact a company from Saudi Arabia.

Now what could be the reason why a company would be willing to pay so much for Niantic? Mr. OKAMOTO explains to us that Niantic has developed several well-known games, like for example Pokemon, Pikmin and Monster Hunter Now. Therefore, the value of the company is considerably high.

In addition, Mr. OKAMOTO tells us that not only do Saudi people like games, they're actually putting in money into esports and investing in companies like Nintendo. We know that whoever owns the tournaments and has enough stocks has the power to lead and guide the direction of the industry where numerous people work and depend on for their daily living. They will all be affected.

In the end, Mr. OKAMOTO wants that not only a single person would win. This is why, the esports team from Japan may mainly have only one champion, but he still has to share the prize money with everyone on the team, because each also contributes to the team's overall success.

This is all for now. Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
