Hi all,

Tonight, we have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki who shares with us something about the type of period in history would he and Tapi-san want to have been born in, and their reason for choosing that particular point in time.

For Mr. OKAMOTO, he prefers the time when there was disorder and chaos, specifically during the Second World War. He says that from the stories of people who lived through that period, their father or siblings died during that time, and so we can't really say that it was a happy kind of moment in history. However, he explains that afterward, the people were able to experience the growth of the nation, and the many things that came to the homes of the people, such as household appliences, that made people's lives so much better. 

As for Tapi-san, she prefers the time when things are already at peace, and away from the disorder and chaos that Mr. OKAMOTO wants.

This is all. Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
