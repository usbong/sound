> 星10ボス級モンスター『マガイマガド』攻略｜モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 46 
 
Hi all,

A pleasant evening! 

Tonight, we do have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki who shares with us several battles he and his team had against the monsters that inhabit the world of Monster Hunter NOW. This time, they're fighting against 10-starred monsters and it looks like these monsters are too powerful for them that they couldn't capture any by the time ran out.

In the other classes, I was also saying that a game could give us 5 minutes to experience whatever it is that it can offer in that short span of time, like Street Fighter II or Zero. In other games, like in the case of Crysis, we could last for as long as 30 minutes, but once we fail, we'd need to start from the beginning again. And I think there are people like myself who'd stop and do something else, instead of run through that part again.

Alternatively, we could also use the time to study. For example, we can use 30 to 45 minutes of our time to study and practice the sample tests at mba.com.

Therefore, I think that it's important to understand why we'd choose to use our time to play, instead of study.

This is all. Thank you. Good night!

Regards,

Mike

p.s. I'll be again joining our friends at AeHIN in a Zoom meeting tonight. It's going to be about having an AI companion in the context of healthcare.
