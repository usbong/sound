> 【３画面】星10ディノバルドをフレンド４人で討伐チャレンジ！｜モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 53

Hi everyone,

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is sharing with us gameplay footages of Monster Hunter NOW (MHN), where he and his companions, which include Mr. Nora, Mr. Banchu, and Ms. Okomesan, have gone out to hunt a number of monsters that inhabit the world of MHN. We know too that his companions are using pseudonames just like in the other gameplay videos of his.

With regard to their battles, it appears that they're not much different from the ones that we've seen before, but there are times when their team almost couldn't capture successfully one of the monsters.

In the other classes, I was wondering whether there'll be something more to this than simply having fun playing, just like in Crysis or Silent Hill f.

This is all. Thank you and good night!

Mike
