> 【２画面】古龍キリン星８討伐｜モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 58 
 
Hello everyone,

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is sharing with us gameplay footages of Monster Hunter NOW. This time, he is with Ms. OCOMESAN in hunting the monster called, "KIRIN." Also, we can see that there are other players who join in, even though Mr. OKAMOTO only emphasized Ms. OCOMESAN as his companion.

As for KIRIN, it has eight stars, but Mr. OKAMOTO's team is able to catch it without much noticeable difficulty. We can however see that Ms. OCOMESAN's screen has some lag, which seems to be something that still exists in this version.

Looking at it now, the game has plenty of components that are noteworthy, for example, the movement of the KIRIN monster, which makes us think that with all these amazing parts, how can we really make something that we'd all want to play?

This is all. Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
