>  【重要】大ヒットゲームに必要な４つの要素をお伝えします。

Hello everyone,

Tonight, we have again plenty of videos from YouTube. But as with the other classes, what I've been writing about is the new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki.

In his new video, he tells us that actually the topic isn't really new, because he's done a video of this before, only it didn't have many viewers.

This time, he's going to speak again about the idea that a great game should have four key elements.

The first is that when a person hears about it, he'd feel excited and would want to know more.

The second is that after seeing the game or a commercial of the game, he'd want to actually play it.

The third is that after actually playing the game, the person would feel incredibly satisified.

The fourth and last is that he'd want to play the game repeatedly.

Mr. OKAMOTO adds that among these four elements, the most important are the second and third, which are after seeing the game, the person would want to play it, and after actually playing the game, the person is satisfied.

This is all. Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
