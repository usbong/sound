> オンラインカジノはグレーゾーンがあるの？｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Hi all,

Tonight, we have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki who shares with us his explanation on whether or not there is a grey zone in online gambling.

First, he says that in Japan, online casinos are prohibited. However, in other countries overseas, it looks like their governments permit the operation of online casinos, only Mr. OKAMOTO thinks that they're likely not paying taxes.

Now with regard to the question, Mr. OKAMOTO explains to us that there is no such grey zone in online gambling. If there are black and white zones, meaning that it's permitted and not respectively, this grey zone would be in the black zone, because the online casino is allowed to operate.

Finally, Mr. OKAMOTO shares us with that he doesn't gamble or play at these places unless he knows that he would win. 

This is all. Thank you. Good night!

Regards,

Mike
