> Q10: Advice for young Singaporeans hoping to join the maritime industry 

Hello everyone,

Tonight, we don't yet have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki, but we do have plenty of other videos from YouTube. In the other classes, I've been sharing two videos, one from UPM Silab (University of the Philippines - Manila) and another from Singapore's Former Prime Minister LEE, Hsien Loong.

In the first video, we learn about the network system that Taiwan is using from Distinguished Professor CHIEN-YEH Hsu of National Taiwan University (NTUNHS). He explains to us that using this network system, patient data could be digitally tranferred from a hospital to the health insurance. Researchers could also get access to the data, so that, for instance, the outcome of a Cancer treatment could be predicted and even prevented. 

From the word, "prevented," I remembered the new video from Singapore's Prime Minister's office where Mr. LEE, Hsien Loong explains to us that he and his team have strived to improve the current system in Singapore so that citizens today won't need to suffer some form of serious tragedy, such as getting killed or dying from things that could be prevented if the system is improved now.

This is all. Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
