> 【少子化問題】20代日本人男性のDT率が42%以上というデータに関して思う事｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Hello everyone,

A pleasant evening to all of you.

Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is sharing with us his thoughts on the problem that Japan's population is continuously aging and there are fewer children being born. 

He gives us data from a news report that he recently encounterd. It said that 42% of Japanese males who are in their 20's have not yet had sexual intercourse. Mr. OKAMOTO tells us that when he was 23 years old, he already got married, just like his classmates at the time too. He believes that to invigorate Japan's GDP, it would be crucial to increase Japan's population.

This is all. Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
