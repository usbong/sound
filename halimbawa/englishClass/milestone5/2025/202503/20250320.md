> S4クライマックスイベントでレア６素材大量ゲットの奇跡起こしたるで｜モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 54

Hello everyone,

Tonight, we again have the annoying noise that has become an everyday occurence, whether it's the early morning, daytime, or evening.

But what I'd really want to share with all of you is the new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki who has for us gameplay footages of he and Ms. Tapi's battles against the monster called, "BAZERGIUS."

In the video, we can see that at 10 stars, this monster proves to be too difficult for Mr. OKAMOTO and Ms. Tapi that they had to try catching it several times more before finally succeeding. It took them over 10 minutes to accomplish the task, but along the way, Mr. OKAMOTO was sharing with us some of the things that he thought could help in defeating this monster, for example, hitting its wings to deal more damage.

This is all. Thank you, and good night!

Regards,

Mike
