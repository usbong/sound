> ナイアンティックが5300億円でゲーム事業売却との報道を受けて 
 
Hello,

This evening, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki has a new video which actually appeared on my YouTube recommendations yesterday. But since he had two videos last night, and it seems that we don't have any new video from him tonight, I thought of sharing with everyone this video about the company Niantic which is selling its video games division for over a billion yen.

Mr. OKAMOTO shares with us that he prefers that Niantic could continue with this business and raise even higher its value. However, he notes that the timing is definitely a factor when it comes to this sort of thing, and perhaps Niantic is doing this now, because now is the perfect time to do so. 

Mr. OKAMOTO adds that he has played and is willing to play Niantic's games, such as Pokemon GO and PIKMIN. And so he firmly believes that there is value in Niantic's video games business.

In the end, Mr. OKAMOTO tells us that if this news is only hearsay, Niantic would have posted a statement that it is not true. However, because we haven't heard or read Niantic deny this information, then we can believe it to be true.

This is all. Thank you. Good night!

Health,

Mike
