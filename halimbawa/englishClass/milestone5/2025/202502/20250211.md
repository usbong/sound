> 猛者たちと挑戦企画！星10イビルジョークリアできる？｜モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 36 
 
Good evening! Tonight, our new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is about the Monster Hunter NOW, where he and his teammates are taking on the challenge of hunting 10-starred monsters that inhabit the MHN world.

In addition, we can hear Mr. OKAMOTO giving us a few advice such as, for instance, if we maintain our HP at max level, we can recover SP. However, I'm not too sure what SP is, although I can think of using SP to make our attacks stronger like a special attack. Still, since I haven't entered the MHN like Mr. OKAMOTO has, I have difficulty understanding its mechanism. Similarly, Mr. OKAMOTO tells us that we should not take off (or lose?) our bullets, which didn't come out too clear for me in terms of meaning. 

Therefore, to really appreciate and understand what Mr. OKAMOTO is telling us, we should get into the MHN world and try it out ourselves, instead of only watching his videos. I think that this is one of the key things that we can learn from his video tonight.

At the moment, I haven't seen the whole video, maybe only up to about 6 minutes, but I think that those who'd want to learn more about what Mr. OKAMOTO is doing, especially what MHN has to offer, then they can check out his video too.

This is all. Thank you. Good night!
