> 彼氏持ちの女の子を好きになったら取る行動を教えます｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Hello,

This evening, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki's new video is about his advice on what we can do if we have a girl whom we like, but she already has a boyfriend.

To be honest, I had difficulty figuring out whether Mr. OKAMOTO actually meant a boy instead of a girl whom the viewers liked. However, the title does explicitly say that it's a girl whom we've come to like, only she has a significant other.

Now, Mr. OKAMOTO tells us that if they haven't gotten married yet, then we shouldn't give up. Also, we should always have a positive response to whatever she asks. Since we could still be with her, Mr. OKAMOTO also advises us that this could take 1 to 1.5 years, therefore we should prepare to do this task for the long run.

This is all. Thank you. Good night!

Mike

Tonight, I'll also be joining a ZOOM meeting held by our friends at AeHIN. It's going to be related to healthcare sandboxes and will be starting in awhile at 19:30.
