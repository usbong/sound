> 現金はいくら手元に残しておくべき？投資効率をグンと上げる『キャッシュポジション』｜岡本吉起塾Ch 

Hello, this evening, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki shares with us a continuation of his talk yesterday. This time, he adds the phrase, "CASH POSITION," in the topic on money and investments.

He explains the "CASH POSITION," tells us where we're at in terms of the amount of money that we have in the form of cash. Remember that he was advising us that we allocate our money in four areas, which include stocks, immovable assets (such as real estate), gold bullions, and cash.

He further reminds us that the value of corporate stocks goes up and down, but as long as we don't sell the stock, we wouldn't really say that we've lost, because we still have the stock. Therefore, once the value of the stock rises, we can also still gain money.

I think that it's important to emphasize here that even if the value of the stock has gone down to zero, it could still go up based on this concept. This is different with cash money which once it has gone down to zero, it cannot go up anymore without our putting more money in our cash pile.

This is all. Thank you. Good night!
