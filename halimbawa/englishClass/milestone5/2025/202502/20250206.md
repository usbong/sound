Hello, this evening, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki has launched two videos, although I've only seen one. This video is about the untimely death of Ms. KOJIMA, Ruriko's husband.

Mr. OKAMOTO says that he has met Ms. KOJIMA one time or another, but he wouldn't say that they're friends. However, the sudden news has made Mr. OKAMOTO think about the importance of time and in this video he shares with us some of his thoughts on the matter.

According to Mr. OKAMOTO, Ms. KOJIMA's husband was a company president and whenever a corporation is established in Japan, there would usually be a need to borrow money which came mainly from the bank. 

Now, just like in his case with Game Republic, there are times when the company has no means to repay the debt, which leads to top executives dying. However, Mr. OKAMOTO tells us that what we can also find out is that despite his many failures, which include the filing for bankruptcy of his company, he was able to find a way to repay back his debt.

So what Mr. OKAMOTO is saying is that if we can somehow win in the end, despite our failures, then we shouldn't bury ourselves with constant worrying. 

Therefore, he adds that if Ms. KOJIMA or whomever is struggling in life especially with regard to money, then they should contact him, so he could help them out.

This is all for now. Thank you. Good night.
