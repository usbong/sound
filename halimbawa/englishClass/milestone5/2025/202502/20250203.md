> 今のアナタに合った効率の良い『自己投資』のやり方について詳しく解説します｜岡本吉起塾Ch 

Hello, good evening! Tonight, our new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is about "Investing in Oneself," which according to Mr. OKAMOTO, is something that perhaps we at times encounter when we're put in a situation where we are asked to do something that we're not wont to do, because it's not in our field of expertise or it's in a totally different industry. Mr. OKAMOTO advises us to try it out, and learn as much as we can, so that if were were to make a chart of our capabilities, our graph would look round, meaning that we can do many things and be quite the all around person. Mr. OKAMOTO adds that once we decide to do anything, we should put in our best effort to accomplish the task.

This is all for now. Thank you. Good night!
