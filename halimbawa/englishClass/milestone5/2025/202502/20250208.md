> モンハンNow強化合宿グループハントで星10連続狩猟してくで｜モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 35

Hello, this evening, our new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is about the Monster Hunter NOW game, which we can see in the video has Mr. OKAMOTO and his team fighting 10-starred monsters three consecutive times. 

If we listen carefully, we could also hear some of the thoughts and ideas of Mr. OKAMOTO regarding his role which is to be the support hunter for his teammates, because he says that he's not really an expert like the other guys, especially with games like MHN. 

From this, we can learn that at times playing the role of support may seem boring and far from exciting, but that may be exactly what the team needs, so we should not be ashamed to work in that type of position.

This is all for now. Thank you, and good night!
