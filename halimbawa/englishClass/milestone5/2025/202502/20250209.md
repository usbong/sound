> 【ジムニーノマド】あのジムニーに5ドアがついにきました！！【SUZUKI】 

Hello, this evening, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki's new video is about the new JIMNY NOMAD that will be coming out in July, August of this year. It's a new model from the car maker SUZUKI, and which now has 5 doors.

Mr. OKAMOTO says that previously, it only had 3 doors, and it was not easy for him to relax, especially when he reclined his seat at the front. 

This time, he thinks that the vehicle is more spacious, and he could relax more easily in this new model.

As for the price, he says that in Japan, it would cost 3 million yen. However, in Malaysia, it would have a price-tag of 10 million yen, which is quite expensive even for Mr. OKAMOTO.

He also shared that Japanese people usually prefer to buy used JIMNY vehicles, and this is what we can see in his case, where he already has quite a number.

This is all for now. Thank you, and good night!
