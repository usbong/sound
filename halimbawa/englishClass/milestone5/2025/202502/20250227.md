> 【ティガレックス攻略】シーズン4のモンスターを狩っていく｜モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 44

Hello,

Tonight, we have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki who again shares with us gameplay footages of Monster Hunter NOW.

This time, he says that new monsters have been added and upon engaging with them in battles, he found them comparatively easy to catch.

Graphically, there appears to be more monster movements as well as eye-catching effects in this video. And I was saying in the other classes that maybe the CAPCOM team behind Monster Hunter Wilds wanted to show that this Monster Hunter NOW for the mobile is still much better.

We may recall that Mr. OKAMOTO had sold his stocks last year, amounting to 2 billion yen, and since he's already past 60 years old, the tax that he'd need to pay should be too high anymore. This is why, we can see that Mr. OKAMOTO has been helping out financially those whom he finds aren't doing as well as him.

This is all. Thank you. Good night!

Health,

Mike
