> 星８大連続(ハッピーセット)狩猟！レア６素材の在庫ある？｜モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 40 

Hello,

This evening, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki has a new video where he shares with us their gameplay footages of Monster Hunter NOW. This time, he and his team are fighting against eight-starred monsters, and it looks like they aren't having such a difficult time hunting these monsters, quite unlike their video with the nine-, or so-starred monsters.

In the other classes, I was saying that I thought that the video was rather long. However, I did watch up until about 14mins into the video, and I was attempting to explain what was in his video that made me want to continue on watching it.

In Japan class, I shared that it was likely because I was looking for something that I could learn from his video. And I said that if I couldn't really find anything to learn from it, then I'd likely stop watching much sooner. If another video of his comes up and appeared to me that it's pretty much the same as the others, then I'd likely stop watching it and go do something else.

In addition, I thought that after we've gotten used to what we're seeing and also doing, we'll find that the cycle of fighting against a continuous series of monsters makes time pass by much faster. However, if there's something that we're looking for, maybe something that Mr. OKAMOTO will ask us later, we'd watch the video again to find it or to know the answer.

This is all for now. Thank you. Good night!
