> 学歴関係なく成功できる！専門学校卒の岡本が提案する稼げる仕事７選｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Hello,

This evening, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki shares with us his new video on his list containing seven occupations that he believes could lead to success, despite not having a notable academic background.

In the other classes, I've been sharing the one about creating your own company. Mr. OKAMOTO says that it's likely that very few would want to work with you, because of your academic background. However, if you first do small tasks for people, and building your credentials along the way, then eventually you could do much more and earn more as well.

In Japanese class, I added that this may not necessarily be a for-profit corporation. The person could provide some kind of valuable service as a self-employed individual.

This is all for now. Thank you. Good night!

Health,

Mike
