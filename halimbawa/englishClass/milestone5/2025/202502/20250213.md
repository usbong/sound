> 猛者たちと挑戦企画！星10モンスター連続討伐｜モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 37 

Hello, this evening, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki's new video is about Monster Hunter NOW, where he and his companions go out to hunt three 10-starred giant monsters that inhabit the world of MHN.

This time, we find that their team could successfully capture three monsters, namely RAAJAN, MAGAMAGAIDO and TSITSIYAKU. Mr. OKAMOTO says that their team was quite strong that they could win against the monsters without too much difficulty.

The other think that we may observe is that there appeared to be more 3D lighting effects in their battles. It reminded me of BANDAI NAMCO which develops the basic parts, while launching products targeted at those who enjoy popular JUMP MANGA characters who also appear in TV as anime, among others.

This is all. Thank you. Good night!
