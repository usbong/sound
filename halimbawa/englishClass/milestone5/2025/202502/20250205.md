> 過去4年で2倍の市場に成長！右肩上がりの日本のゲーム産業を語ります｜岡本吉起塾Ch 

Hello, this evening, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki's new video is about the video games industry, which he says has grown its market size two times in the past 4 years. Mr. OKAMOTO believes that in this industry, Japanese people are still respected, especially after creating and launching so many titles that players all over the world can recognize; however, he also knows that many game creators from outside Japan have entered the industry and are taking the place of the Japanese in roles that used to be dominated by Japanese people. He also shares an observation that while grade school students in Japan would still dream of workin in this industry, as they grow older, they'd begin to prefer to work in another field. For example, university graduates would opt to work in the bank and such places that are for the so-called "elites." Despite this, Mr. OKAMOTO hopes that the Japanese people who are working in this relatively small industry would work hard and do their utmost best. This is all for now. Thank you, and good night!
