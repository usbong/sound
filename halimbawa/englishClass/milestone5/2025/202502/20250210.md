> 【解説】勝手にお金が増え続ける資産家のポートフォリオを教えます｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Hello, this evening, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki's new video is about his technique of continuously increasing his money.

As a holder of many assets, his portfolio has four areas where he puts his money.

One is in cash, the second is in stocks, the third is in immovable assets like his house, and finally in gold form.

All of these, except the gold, would have 30% of his total money. For gold, he puts 10%. He explains that the value of gold hardly ever changes, so it's quite a stable currency.

Now, he shares with us that since the value of a corporation's stocks move up and down in a wave-like motion, when the value of his own stocks go down, he would get his cash in reserve and buy more of the company's stocks, because he believes that its value would later rise. Once it has risen, he'll sell the stocks for a profit. He'll then allocate this profit in the other areas that are in his portfolio.

This is all. Thank you. Good night.
