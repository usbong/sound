Hello,

This evening, we don't yet have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki. It could be because he opted to rest. Today is Sunday, so we do know that at times, people would want to do something else, and not keep on doing the same type of task that he has been doing during the rest of the week.

Actually, I think there was a time when I thought of doing my work at the time even during Sundays, which was our rest day at the clinics that I visited. However, perhaps, it was also because we had rest days that I was able to do other things like eating out there in Miguel & Maria, which used to have the oyster sisig, which reminded me of the Two Seasons in Boracay where I first heard about it from a grade school and high school batchmate who was also invited to a friend's wedding. I'd go bike to the restaurant there and by around 11AM order lunch. I knew that more people would be coming later, so I went there earlier. At the time, there was a musician who played violin and I even bought his CD. It's been over two years I think since I last did this, and there have been changes in the menu and such things. In any case, I hardly eat oyster, if at all, anymore.

The other thing that I also did at the time was to go to the public swimming pool at the Sports Center. But I guess that is another story for another time.

This is all. Thank you. Good night!
