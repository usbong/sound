> BREAKING: Trump—Flanked By Larry Ellison, Sam Altman, & Masayoshi Son—Announces Project Stargate 

Hello, this evening, we again have plenty of videos from YouTube.

I've been focusing on three videos in the other classes, and the first one is from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki.

In this video, he shares with us that while he doesn't usually complain about the Japanese government, this time, he wanted to tell us that due to a rule that the Japanese government came up with, Japanese workers who want to continue to work aren't permitted to do so.

He gives as example data saying that in 1961, Japanese people worked 2400 hours in a year, but in 2022, it has gone down to only 1700 hours per year.

And since the Japanese people aren't working as much, their income has also decreased.

Mr. OKAMOTO also shares with us that when he was working he had a schedule that let him work from Mondays to Saturdays, and then for the following week, he worked from Mondays to Fridays, afterward his work schedule returned to the former.

The second video that I'd want to share with you all is the one from Bill GATES, who shows us some of the things that we can learn from his new book, a memoir, with the title, "Source Code." I thought that I'd want to learn more about his life through this book, particularly his story with his grandmother, the first time he asked a girl out, his life while he was in Harvard and when he went out of Harvard.

The third video that I'd want to share is the video from Forbes. In the video, we can see that U.S. President Donald TRUMP is with Larry ELLISON, Masayoshi SON and Sam ALTMAN as they inform us about the 500 billion investment that is being given to the United States, so that AI could be further developed in America, and whose main use will be in the field of healthcare, where as explained by Larry, health workers could quickly learn about what is being done in other places, and that a drug to treat cancer could be quickly developed in a span of 48 hours upon getting a blood sample from the patient for that patient using AI, among others.

This is all for now. Thank you and have a great evening!
