> 【一審無罪判決】紀州のドンファン事件の真相はいかに？なぜ有罪にならなかったのか｜岡本吉起塾Ch 

Hello, this evening, our new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is about the Donfan murder incident where a woman was suspected of murdering Donfan, but the Wakayama Trial Court did not find sufficient evidence to put her behind bars. In other words, she was acquitted. 

Wakayama is a prefecture in the Kansai region. And Mr. OKAMOTO tells us that a case can proceed from Wakayama, to Osaka, then to a much higher court if necessary.

Still, in this case, what we learn is that even though the woman's computer had several search words such as stimulants and marijuana, these weren't enough for the court to give her a life imprisonment verdict for murder. 

In addition, Mr. OKAMOTO predicts that there will be more similar cases that'll come out, especially after the verdict in this case.

This is all for now. Thank you and have a great evening.
