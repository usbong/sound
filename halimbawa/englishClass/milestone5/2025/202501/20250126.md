Hello, this evening, we don't yet have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki. It could be because he opted to rest. Today is after all a Sunday. 

Nevertheless, we still do have plenty of videos from YouTube, although what I've been sharing with the other language classes was the news from TV, on channel 7 (or GMA7). I caught sight of a piece of news saying that Ms. Gloria Romero has passed away at 91 years old. We know her for being the first Filipina to win in the Miss World Beauty Contest as well as an actress and TV personality here in the Philippines.

If we look at the average age or the average lifespan of a Filipino, we'd find that it's only up to 70 years old. In other countries like Singapore, data would tell us that a person born in 2023 could be expected to live up to 80 years old.

Faced with this information, what are we to do? 

What I've been doing is to learn the lives of senior people and find out who could live much longer, and use what I can learn from them to live a much longer life too.

This is all for now. Thank you and have a great evening.
