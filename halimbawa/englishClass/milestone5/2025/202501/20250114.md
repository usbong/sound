> I visited Kemmerer, Wyoming to celebrate the next nuclear breakthrough 

Hello, this evening, we're going to do another one of our English practices. Tonight, we have so many videos that in fact, I haven't seen all of them. In the other classes, I've been focusing on the new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki who shares with us another gameplay footage of Monster Hunter NOW. 

Now what is different here is that Mr. OKAMOTO is hunting the 8-star Kusharudaora by himself, without any companions at all. We know that he usually hunts with his subordinates, but this time, none of them seem to be around. However, we find that 2 or 3 other players come and join him in the battle. 

I thought that they may have been the AI working, but Mr. OKAMOTO emphasis more the idea that the game has been designed so that if we are in a particular place where there are other players, then they can join and help us out in the battles, so that we'd be able to defeat rather easily super strong monsters which we'd not win against if we had been by ourselves.

Finally, I do want to add the new video from Mr. Bill GATES who shares a short video with us on his trip to Wyoming where there has been a breakthrough in the use of nuclear energy which has created a "big change in how America and the world get their energy."

This is all for now. Thank you, and good evening.
