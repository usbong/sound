> 年収1000万円の人ほど仕事も私生活もキツイ理由｜岡本吉起塾Ch 

Hello, this evening, we're going to again practice the English language. We do have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki who shares with us tonight something about money. He says that there are people who aim for 10 million yen per year as their income. However, because prices of commodities have increased and are likely to further increase, it would be best that people aimed for something much higher.

For example, 20 million yen per year, and so on and so forth, espeially if the person has already achieved the 10 million yen per year income.

Mr. OKAMOTO also adds that in Japan, in 20 employees, only 1 of them would have such an income. This means that only 20% of employees could achieve this sum.

Therefore, Mr. OKAMOTO gives us his advice, so that we may be among those few who can earn 10 million yen and up per year.

The first advice that he gave was to succeed at work, that is, succeed at our current workplace, so that we can earn much higher.

The next advice is that we go do a secondary job that could add more money into our annual income.

Finally, he says that we tranfer to a company that would give a much higher income.

This is all for now. Thank you, have a great evening.
