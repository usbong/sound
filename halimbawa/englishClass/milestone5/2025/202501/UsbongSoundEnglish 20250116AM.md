> Deep Dive on the Open Health Stack by Mr. Jing Tang (Google Health Open Health Stack Software Engineer)

Hello, today, we're going to again practice the English language. Yesterday, I joined a Zoom Meeting hosted by the University of the Philippines - Manila's SiLab to learn about what Google is currently working on and what technologies I could apply in my own situation.

First, I learned that the FHIR component has been added into applications like ODK and Sana Mobile of over 10 years ago to make it much faster to transfer patient data from one hospital to another.

However, while the team has succeeded in this regard, I predict that the system isn't going to be used at private clinics, especially because the clinic is still profitable due to the many patients who come for consultation even without such a system in-place.

In addition, we find that most of the illnesses that common patients have aren't so complex, and the solution is usually achieved through simple things like regular exercise and healthy diet. 

Yet because people also continue to give birth to more and more children, the number of patients doesn't decrease, and I don't foresee this situation changing even in the future.
