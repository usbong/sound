> 【示談金9000万円】元SMAP中居正広さん女性トラブル、多額の示談金の意味は？｜岡本吉起塾Ch 

Hello, this evening, we're going to again practice the English language. This time, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is sharing with us an incident concerning a former SMAP member, who's name is Mr. NAKAI, Masahiro. 

According to Mr. OKAMOTO, news about this incident has gotten quite the attention, appearing on local TV, although because Mr. OKAMOTO is living outside Japan, he didn't know much about this and so had not talked about it at all.

From what we can learn from Mr. OKAMOTO's explanation, Mr. NAKAI had a problem with a woman who agreed to receive 90 million yen from Mr. NAKAI to settle their dispute, but with the condition that she won't tell anybody about it. 

Later on, we learn that the woman began to speak about it and even Mr. NAKAI's best friend have gotten news about what had happened.

So they went to a trial court to receive help in solving the issue. Mr. OKAMOTO says that it may be possible that Mr. NAKAI would be able to receive the 90 million yen that he had given to the woman to close the case.

This is all for now. Thank you and have a great evening.
