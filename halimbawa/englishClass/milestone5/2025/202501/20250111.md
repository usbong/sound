> モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 29｜ソロで星９モンスターに挑戦してくで！ 

Hello, this evening, we're going to do another one of our English practices. Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki shares with us in his new video several battles that he had with the monsters of Monster Hunter NOW.

We learn that the monsters are classified to be nine-star creatures, meaning that they're extremely strong. This is why, Mr. OKAMOTO at times couldn't win against them, especially if only by himself. Other times, he'd win, but not without struggling somewhat during the battle.

We also hear about the light bow-gun which according to Mr. OKAMOTO is a ranged weapon, but if the hunter is too far, the weapon's efficacy goes down. In addition, he shares with us that he doesn't expect to get much reward in terms of rare items that come out after beating a monster. I think this is supposed to mean that the hunter would need to use the hagitori (?) knife, so that more rare items would appear.

Finally, he could hear in the video, the phrase, "hadouken," which may indicate that Mr. OKAMOTO is also working on a project that uses the camera angle that we see in MHN to create a new type of fighting game.

OK. This is all for now. Thank you, and good night!
