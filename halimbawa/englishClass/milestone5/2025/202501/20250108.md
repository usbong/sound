> 皆さんはどう感じました？とある女医さんが大炎上した件に思うこと｜岡本吉起塾ch 

Hello, this evening, we're going to again practice the English language. Tonight, we do have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki who shares with us something about how a post containing a photo or photos of donated bodies for students in medical school, specifically the school that specializes in women's beautification surgical treatments, has created a huge heated discussion online.

Mr. OKAMOTO reminds us that people at times write comments on social media without thinking carefully before posting. Therefore, he says that Web 2.0 and such technologies are quite frightening. But if we can keep in mind the consequences of our actions online, then we should be able to create a more welcoming Internet.

Thank you. This is all for now.
