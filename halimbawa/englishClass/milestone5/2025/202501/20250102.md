>  モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 25｜【３画面マルチプレイ】討伐激ムズモンスターに挑戦するで！ 

Hello, this evening, we're going to practice the English language. This time, our new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is about the Monster Hunter NOW game. 

In this video, he shares with us that they're going to hunt the 9-starred monsters, which are supposed to be the super difficult ones in the game.

We could also hear some of the reactions of the two companions of Mr. OKAMOTO, and I thought that they were all playing in a way that reminded me of children who had to follow their fearless leader, even though they didn't really want to do so.

I think I was saying in Japanese class that it could be that they didn't really have anything else to do, which meant that they had free time, so they might as well go and do this challenge with Mr. OKAMOTO.

OK. I think we can stop here already. Thanks for joining me this evening. We'll see each other soon!
