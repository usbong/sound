> 同じ悪夢を見るループから抜け出せた方法【夢診断】｜岡本吉起Ch 

Hello, this evening, we're going to again practice the English language. Tonight, we do have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki, but before we dive in and talk about his new video, I do want say that I didn't get to do any of these short essays yesterday anymore, because I went out to meet a friend from France. We first met over 10 years ago, and after that span of time, we finally got to meet each other again, and I have to say that his Chinese Mandarin is now pretty impressive.

Now, with regard to Mr. OKAMOTO's new video, tonight he's sharing with us a dream that he's been having over and over again. He says that it's actually a bad dream where someone is chasing Mr. OKAMOTO with the evil intent of murdering him. He continues that he'd always try to get away, but the person could always catch him and hit him at the back. Afterwards, he'd awaken.

He also tells us that this dream started when he became successful after the launching of Street Fighter 2.

Finally, he invites everyone to write down their thoughts and experiences on the matter and share them in the comments. Meanwhile, Mr. OKAMOTO still has many more stories to tell us, and is quite glad of having us as company.

This is all for now. Thank you, and have a great evening.
