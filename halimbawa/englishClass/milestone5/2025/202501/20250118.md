 > 【モンハンNow】第５回オフ合宿開催のお知らせ（２月１５日〜２月１６日） 
 
Hello, this evening, we're going to again practice the English language. Tonight, we do have an announcement from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki who shares with us an event that they're organizing for players of the Monster Hunter Now game. 

It'll be held next month in February, specifically Feb. 15 until Feb. 16. They'll begin at noontime of Feb. 15 and end at eight in the evening of the following day, Feb. 16, which is a Sunday.

They're currently accepting applications to participate in the said event, and Mr. OKAMOTO says that they're getting 12 people who'll be selected via some kind of lottery. 

Mr. OKAMOTO adds that participants should bring their own vehicles to the venue, although Mr. OKAMOTO and his team would have their own vehicles to go to the event.

Finally, the minimum Monster Hunter rank should be 150, while the monsters should be 10-star level.

This is all for now. Thank you, and have a great evening!
