>  現役ゲームプロデューサー岡本が考える“売れるゲーム”企画のアイディアの出し方 

Hello, this evening, we're going to practice again the English language. Tonight, we do have a new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki who shares with us his way of generating ideas for a sellable game.

First, he says that he doesn't recommend coming up with ideas from nothing, which he calls zero-to-one, because he thinks that this type of creating is too difficult and rare. Instead, he recommends that like him, we play games as much as we can, and then when we begin to find faults or areas for improvement, we would be able to have ideas for a sellable game.

Of course, launching a game without any improvement whatsoever is not advisable, especially because it would appear to be a complete copy of the game.

Therefore, we all ought to come up with ideas that would further improve the games that we enjoy, as well as those that we've gotten not to enjoy.

This is all for now. Thank you, and have a pleasant evening.
