> モンスターハンターNOW 実況 Part 27｜マルチプレイで狩りたいモンスター狩っていくで！ 

Hello, this evening, we're going to again practice the English language. Tonight, Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki shares with us his new gameplay video of the game, Monster Hunter NOW. He adds that he is accompanied by his usual companions whom we may now recognize to be Mr. MASAMI, Ms. ASAMI, and, I think, Mr. KAZUMA.

Remember that Mr. MASAMI and Ms. ASAMI, in particular, revealed themselves in the previous Monster Hunter Now gameplay video of theirs yesterday. However, this time, we recognize some change in their voice patterns, likely due to a tool that automatically adjusts these things, although Ms. ASAMI's laughter, for instance, makes it possible to now recognize her.

In the other classes, I was sharing that one reason that we can come up with why people would want to use a voice-pattern manipulator is so that it'll be difficult for people to identify their real names, etc, which can explained as a matter of security against cyber criminals, among others.

However, we also know that there are people who use the same technology, instead of as a defense against attackers, to annoy people or scam them. 

Therefore, as I said in Japanese class, technology and its effects depend on people's usage.

This is all for now. Thank you, and have a great evening!
