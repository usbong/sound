> 女医さんSNS炎上の問題で、皆さんに分かってほしいこと｜岡本吉起塾ch 

Hello, this evening, we're going to again practice the English language. Tonight, our new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is actually a continuation of his video yesterday. Remember that he was sharing yesterday an incident that created a huge uproar online due to photos of donated bodies were uploaded on social media. 

In this video, he says that anyone who's become aware that such things are being done wouldn't anymore want to donate. So here he clarifies that he's still encouraging people to donate. We know that the bodies are going to help the students in medical school, so that there'll be more people who'd be saved through medical treatment.

This is all for now. Thank you.
