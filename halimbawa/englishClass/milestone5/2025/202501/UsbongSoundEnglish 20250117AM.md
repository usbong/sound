> 1/17 weekly gm ライブ配信（ゲスト: JPYC 岡部典孝） | 伊藤穰一 

Good afternoon! Today, we'll be practicing the English language.

We're doing this today instead of yesterday evening, because I was invited by my younger brother for dinner, so I thought that I'll just do the practice for yesterday evening today.

Now, today our topic is about Mr. ITO, Joi-ichi's weekly gm this morning.

At the start of the meeting, we heard news about the CES which was held recently in the U.S. Ms. Mariko shared that it was her first time to ride a vehicle without a human driver, and she was amazed by how AI could already do such a feat. Mr. ITO agreed with Ms. Mariko, but felt that the vehicle moved much slower than he thought.

Next, Mr. OKABU of JPYC shared a presentation about their company and how their business is using virtual currency to make the community more efficient. More specifically, users of JPYC's platform can now more easily transfer money, like, for instance, to make payments and to also receive money. In addition, because there's no service fee taken for every transfer, it helps reduce costs for the users.

Having said this, of course, we'd all want to know how exactly JPYC makes money. When Mr. KOMUGI asked Mr. OKABE this question, what we learn is that money deposited by users into the platform do not gain any interest. JPYC takes the interest and puts them all together with the goal of receiving the approx. 22% forecasted total interest that could be profited through the virtual currency.

Another thing to note is that according to the rules and regulations, money transferred from JPYC to another platform would have a service fee.

Mr. KOMUGI then asks Mr. OKABE why people would want to use JPYC's platform, instead of cash and the common bank. The reply was that right now it's difficult to connect apps built by other companies to those systems, making them inconvenient especially for small companies and those without any strong connections to be able to use their platform.

This is all for now. Thank you.
