> 新SNS『MIXI2』って何？モンスト開発者の一人でもある岡本吉起がお世話になっているMIXI社の新SNSについて調べてみました｜岡本吉起塾Ch

Hello, this evening, our new video from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki is about the new social media called "MIXI2." 

According to Mr. OKAMOTO, he was able to achieve great success with the first MIXI where he and his team developed the hit game, Monster Strike. This is why, he has been trying out the new MIXI, and says that since he doesn't have a lot of followers yet, around 12 people only, it doesn't tire him too much to write comments and reply to people.

In addition, he says that MIXI2 is open through invites, so if a friend of yours invites you, you can try out the service yourself. However, without that invitation, it wouldn't be possible for you to create an account yet on the service at this present point in time.

Finally, Mr. OKAMOTO has observed that the stock price of the company that owns MIXI1 and 2 have skyrocketed and he'll be learning about the new service so more and share with us his findings as well as his insights.

Thank you. And a good evening to all.
