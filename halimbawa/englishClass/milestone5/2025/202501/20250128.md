> バーチャファイターが帰ってくる！新生VFに期待していることは…？『New VIRTUA FIGHTER』発表記念に初代VFを振り返る 

Hello, this evening, we have an announcement from Mr. OKAMOTO, Yoshiki about the upcoming "New VIRTUA FIGHTER" from Sega. 

According to Mr. OKAMOTO, he still remembers having first seen VF with its 3D graphics and character movements which he made him also want to create his own 3D game. However, at the time, Capcom didn't have the hardware and the programming capabilities that Sega had, so he couldn't realize this objective.

Meanwhile, he points out in the video a characteristic of VF which is the use of the guard/block button. For a not so spectacular player like Mr. OKAMOTO, it was difficult for him to get used to this control scheme. In addition, he shares with us that VF made use of the "RING OUT" rule, which could at times dramatically change the outcome of a fight, especially when a fighter has gotten low remaining health, yet because he was able to get his opponent outside the ring, he still won.

Finally, Mr. OKAMOTO tells us that Sega's two most popular IPs would have to be Sonic and Virtua Fighter, although when eventually less and less people bought their games, such that the last Virtua Fighter came out as far back as 2006.

This is all for now. Thank you.
